# Mechanics
A miscellaneous plugin to do various things too small for us to bother to make a plugin for.

Currently, it provides:
  - Custom health regeneration; 10% every 5 seconds if not harmed.
  - Arrow despawning; no need for arrows to stay on the ground.
  - Mage Wand Funnels of Death; primary attack of Mages. We might want to make this less scary.
