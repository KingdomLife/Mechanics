# Mechanics
A miscellaneous plugin to do various things too small for us to bother to make a plugin for.

Currently, it provides:
  - Custom health regeneration; 10% every 5 seconds if not harmed.
  - Arrow despawning; no need for arrows to stay on the ground.
  - Mage primary attack spell.
  - CRIT_MAGIC teleportation effect.
  - In the works: Forcing a class.
